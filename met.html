      <h1> Our Story:</h1>
      <br>
      <p> So many people may think that the way we met was a scene in a romantic movie,
        but we promise this is how it happened.The photo that you see on the background
        is actually taken right after our first time meeting. That's right, we met on a plane.
        We were both flying to Manila from another island, and the amazing story is that we both
        weren't supposed to be on that flight. Jhoy was planning on taking an earlier flight into
        Manila, while I was planning on not even going on the flight. Both our original plans
        didn't work out and we ended up on that flight together.</p>

        <h2>Dating</h2>
        <br>
        <p> Jhoy and I started dating on August 28,2019 so as of today we are celebrating
          our second monthsary. Unlike most people today, we didn't start dating right away, and
          in fact, I took two months of constantly messaging her when I could and just trying to make
          sure that she was having a wonderful day every day. On my end (Scott) I had a feeling that she was
          special and that I wanted to date her from day one, but I didn't want to rush into things. I also
          didn't think I would see her again so I didn't expect much. But every day, I started to fall for
          her more and more.
